All natural and some are organic. All cider can benefit from adding a bit of [apple flavor](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004QXKQN8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B004QXKQN8&linkCode=as2&tag=howtomakeha07-20&linkId=MCUDFBIKWTK63URI), because it tells your nose, ‚ÄúHey! Apples!‚Äù Other recommended flavors are [cinnamon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004QXKOXU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004QXKOXU&linkCode=as2&tag=howtomakeha07-20&linkId=YAPIT5FEWNM6HMRX) (very aromatic, take it easy!), [blackberry](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002X4HNTW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002X4HNTW&linkCode=as2&tag=howtomakeha07-20&linkId=A6SSU47OBJJ63EFD) or [raspberry](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VE0RH6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000VE0RH6&linkCode=as2&tag=howtomakeha07-20&linkId=YBGDDA3DYLCZCQMM) (beyond these three you are out of my charted waters).

-   [www.gemvintners.com](http://www.gemvintners.com/) ‚Äì Great resource for good prices of all manner of brew and wine equipment I get all of my CellarCraft red wine kits here. Top notch.
-   [www.homebrew4less.com](http://www.homebrew4less.com/) ‚Äì Super nice folks and really personal service. Blaine the owner often signs the shipping invoice himself! Once he shipped me a limited release port wine kit that he was saving for himself because they sold out! Wow. Who does that? Fast shipping and great prices.

## Curious about the Amazon links all over this site?

Because of my remote location, I have been buying brew supplies on-line for close to 15 years. Amazon simply the best place to buy a wide selection of brew gear (most of the major vendors are now selling there), and they often offer free shipping. I extensively researched the prices on all of these products to get you the best deals, because hey, if you are making your own brew, you want to brag about how affordable it is, right? Buying on Amazon gets you the same products for less money. For situations where a more affordable option is available, you will find links directly to that vendor.

Also, this site is connected with Amazon affiliates, so when you click on one of the links, we get a small kickback from Amazon **at absolutely no charge to you.** If you‚Äôd like to say ‚Äúthanks‚Äù for what you learned on this site, you can click into Amazon from one of these links and _any purchase_ you make will also help support this site. Some folks have let me know they are bookmarking a link and using it whenever they shop on Amazon! Zowie! I so appreciate your kindness and support in keeping this site growing üôÇ

## If you want to be a success right off the bat, or you are making 5+ gallons, here are books I found useful:

-   **_Cider ‚Äì Hard and Sweet_**, by Ben Watson ‚Äì Sep. 2013\. [Order it for \$15 with free ship from Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1581572077/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1581572077&linkCode=as2&tag=howtomakeha07-20&linkId=LKY3YWXUXZXTHYWI) ‚Äì This is the book I recommend for anyone wanting to take it to the next level. Lots of practical tips for those of you who have access to fresh milled cider, or who are wanting to make 5+ gallons at a time. Nice overviews of yeast, apples, cider history, and also a chapter on making apple cider vinegar. **This is the book I recommend to _everyone_ who is a beginning cider brewer,** or moving up into that 6 gallon carboy. I own the second edition, but I bet this newer one is top notch too.
-   **_Craft Cider Making_**, by Andrew Lea ‚Äì Feb 2011\. [\$13 ships free from Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1904871984/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1904871984&linkCode=as2&tag=howtomakeha07-20&linkId=YVBSXA5L2TOIUGMN) ‚Äì A wealth of information by the modern godfather of cider brewing, Englishman and food chemist Dr. Andrew Lea. I don‚Äôt have this newest update of his book yet, but very much looking forward to getting it. My food science heritage makes me devour anything that Dr. Lea writes, and it you are interested in the ‚Äúhows and whys‚Äù of cider making, then this book is for you. Dr. Lea is an excellent writer and I find his work interesting and entertaining, but if you are not into chemistry, you might find some of it a bit too detailed. Not to worry, this book is full of useful info for even the hobby brewer, and it will tell you everything you need to know to create delicious and repeatedly predictable hard cider. If you really want to hone your craft this is the book to get. His website [www.cider.org.uk](http://www.cider.org.uk/) has an incredible amount of information as well, and is the inspiration for the creation of this website üôÇ
